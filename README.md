CardCrafter
===========

Card Crafter is an app written in C# to create neat, printable HTML cards for Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition Powers, Monsters and Classes. HTML stolen from here: http://omnichron.net/external/op/tools/pow.html. I couldn't find an email address to ask if I could use it, so I used it anyway... hope that doesn't bite me in the ass later.
